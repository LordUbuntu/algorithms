# ROT13, ROTate 13 Cypher
# A simple rotational cypher algorithm that rotates the values of symbols (letters) within a symbol space (alphabet) over by 13 symbols within that order. Imagine arranging the alphabet in a ring, then take any letter and move 13 in a chosen direction. To decypher, rotate all the letters back the other way.
