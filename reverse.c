/* Jacobus Burger (2022)
 *
 * Info:
 *      I wondered about a fast way to reverse an array of elements
 *      and imagined iterating halfway across the array and then
 *      swapping the current element with its "mirror".
 * Explanation:
 *      The algorithm works by iterating through half the length of
 *      the array, it then swaps the current element with its
 *      "mirror" (the current index from the length of the whole array).
 *      This results in swapping all the elements swapping in what
 *      I approximate to be O(n/2) time.

                array[i] = array[length - i - 1];
