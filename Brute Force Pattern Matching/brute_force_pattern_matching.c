 * Brute Force Pattern Matching (C99)
 * Brute Force Pattern Matching is a brute force approach to matching
 *      a substring of a larger string of contiguous data. It does so
 *      by comparing the first letter of the substring with the current
 *      letter in the string until it finds a match, then compares to
 *      see that the substring and that section of the string both
 *      match. This is an obvious approach, but isn't very effective
 *      when compared to more clever approaches.
 * Pattern Matching has a lot of great applications in multiple
 *      disciplines, such as for bioinformatics.
