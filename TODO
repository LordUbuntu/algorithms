- each file will implement the algorithm code snippets alone, but i don't want to write a demo program for each one so i'll leave that out except to check and verify the program works as intended.


- For reference on structure see https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python



- An interesting property is that since this repository is multilingual each language in a folder may have a different solution to that problem.



- It should go without saying that every algorithm and data structure has its pros and cons depending on the situational context. 



- Notably, some algorithms and data structures are used in others at times
