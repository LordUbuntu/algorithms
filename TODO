  - change bubble sort implementations (to align with actual Bubble Sort algorithm)











- create a checklist of algorithms to implement and learn, to keep track of what was
  implemented. Then this can be a place to quickly learn a new language by going
  through a fast-checklist of algorithms, maybe even make a speedrun of it! What algorithms to choose though?




- investigate ropes and other string data structure implementations




- main guiding principles:
  - start with main languages (Python, C) preferred
  - any languages may be used
  - write the solution in a way that is idiomatic to the given language


- a friend asked a good question, what's the domain and bigger goals!?
- (list of data structures)
- use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms

- As always, algorithms and data structures can be combined however you would like, implemented with eachother, and whatever else. I chose to keep each algorithm and data structure file self-contained without any dependencies on eachother.

- every string algorithm can be done on _ANY_ string of data, not just strings of characters. String here can often mean text-interpreted data, but any other form of data interpretation is possible! So long as its a sequential list of symbols. The only limit is your imagination!

- for C99:
  - should be able to compile with any compiler (cc, gcc, and clang)
  - all warnings on, std set to c99
  - valgrind on code with dynamic memory to check for leaks

- I'll leave demos, I'll add them when needed but let code rest on its own otherwise. Good to though, lets people play around with and see how these Data Structures and Algorithms work in action.

- For reference on structure see https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python



- An interesting property is that since this repository is multilingual each language in a folder may have a different solution to that problem.



- It should go without saying that every algorithm and data structure has its pros and cons depending on the situational context. 



- Notably, some algorithms and data structures are used in others at times
