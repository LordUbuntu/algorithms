- use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms

- for C99:
  - clang compiler (more thorough it looks like)
  - valgrind on code with dynamic memory to check for leaks

- i'll leave demos, i'll add them when needed but let code rest on its own otherwise. Good to though, lets people play around with and see how these Data Structures and Algorithms work in action.

- For reference on structure see https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python



- An interesting property is that since this repository is multilingual each language in a folder may have a different solution to that problem.



- It should go without saying that every algorithm and data structure has its pros and cons depending on the situational context. 



- Notably, some algorithms and data structures are used in others at times
